# code-refactor-time

This is my code refactor live website: https://tylercmac.github.io/code-refactor-time/

This is a website that worked properly, but had poor CSS semantics that made much of the selector attributes redundant. It has been refactored to allow for better accessibility, and the CSS semantics were reworked to be more logical.
